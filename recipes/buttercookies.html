<h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p>
        These no-bake five-ingredient cookies will satisfy any sweet 
        tooth with their peanut butter fudgy taste. Some reviewers like
        to add butterscotch chips or chocolate drizzle to these cookies 
        for extra sweetness. "Simple and quick — the perfect go to recipe
        when you need a little treat," says home cook RedApple.

            Place the corn flakes into a large bowl, and pour the peanut
            butter mixture over the cereal. Mix until the corn flakes are 
            coated with the mixture. Drop by tablespoon onto the waxed paper;
            flatten slightly if desired. Allow to cool before serving.
