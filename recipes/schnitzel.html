<h2>Descritpion</h2>
    <p>
        Traditional Wiener Schnitzel is pounded, breaded, 
        and pan-fried veal cutlets. But if veal is the traditional 
        cut of choice for schnitzel in the classic style of Vienna, 
        the truth is you can "schnitzel" all types of cutlets of pork, 
        chicken, and beef (typically cheaper cuts like round steak, 
        chuck, or cube steaks). Around here, we take a pretty liberal 
        interpretation of schnitzel. That way, we can expand our 
        definition to include the Italian-inspired cotoletta alla 
        Milanese, Japanese katsu and tonkatsu, and the Southern classic 
        chicken-fried steak, a.k.a. country-fried steak. And enjoy them 
        all! Here are some of our very favorite schnitzel recipes.

        <li>2 pounds veal </li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil </li>

        <li>
            Cut the veal into steaks, about as thick as your finger. 
            Dredge in flour. In a shallow dish, beat the eggs with 1 
            tablespoon oil, salt and pepper. Coat the veal with egg 
            mixture, then with bread crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1/4 cup oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. 
            Fry veal until golden brown, about 5 minutes on each side.
